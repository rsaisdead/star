# OQS AES256 + Kyber1024 + Dilithium5 Hybrid Key Exchange

1. Start a TCP Socket.

2. Both Client and Server initialize:
    - Signature algorithm: `let sigalg = sig::Sig::new(sig::Algorithm::Dilithium5)?;`
    - KEM algorithm: `let kemalg = kem::Kem::new(kem::Algorithm::Kyber1024)?;`

### Phase 1: Public Signature Key Exchange

3. Server generates Dilithium5 signature keys:
    `let (b_sig_pk, b_sig_sk) = sigalg.keypair()?;`

4. Server sends its signature public key (`b_sig_pk`) -> Client.

5. Client receives and **verifies** `b_sig_pk` to ensure it's valid and not malicious.

6. Client generates its Dilithium5 signature keys:
    `let (a_sig_pk, a_sig_sk) = sigalg.keypair()?;`

7. Client sends its signature public key (`a_sig_pk`) -> Server.

8. Server receives and **verifies** `a_sig_pk`.

### Phase 2: KEM Public Key Exchange with Signatures

9. Client generates Kyber1024 KEM keypair:
    `let (kem_pk, kem_sk) = kemalg.keypair()?;`

10. Client signs the KEM public key (`kem_pk`) with its signature secret key:
    `let kem_signature = sigalg.sign(kem_pk.as_ref(), &a_sig_sk)?;`

11. Client sends `(kem_pk, kem_signature)` -> Server.

12. Server verifies the signature on `kem_pk`:
    `sigalg.verify(kem_pk.as_ref(), &kem_signature, &a_sig_pk)?;`

13. Server encapsulates the shared secret (`ss`) using `kem_pk`:
    `let (kem_ct, b_kem_ss) = kemalg.encapsulate(&kem_pk)?;`

14. Server signs the ciphertext (`kem_ct`) with its signature secret key:
    `let ct_signature = sigalg.sign(kem_ct.as_ref(), &b_sig_sk)?;`

15. Server sends `(kem_ct, ct_signature)` -> Client.

16. Client verifies the signature on `kem_ct`:
    `sigalg.verify(kem_ct.as_ref(), &ct_signature, &b_sig_pk)?;`

17. Client decapsulates the shared secret (`ss`) using its KEM private key:
    `let a_kem_ss = kemalg.decapsulate(&kem_sk, &kem_ct)?;`

### Phase 3: Verifying Shared Secrets

18. Server generates a sha3_256 hash of his shared secret (`ss`):
    `let b_ss_hash = sha3_256(b_kem_ss)?;`

19. Server signs the shared secret hash (`b_ss_hash`):
    `let b_ss_signature = sigalg.sign(b_ss_hash.as_ref(), &b_sig_sk)?;`

20. Server sends `(b_ss_hash, b_ss_signature)`

21. Client verifies shared secret hash signature (`b_ss_hash`):
    `sigalg.verify(b_ss_hash.as_ref(), &b_ss_signature, &b_sig_pk)?;`

22. Client generates a sha3256 hash of his shared secret (`a_kem_ss`)
    `let a_ss_hash = sha3_256(a_kem_ss)?;`

23. Client compares both shared secret hashes (`*_ss_hash`):
    `asserteq!(a_ss_hash, b_ss_hash);`

### Phase 4: Communication Using Shared Secret

24. Both parties now have the same shared secret (`ss`) and can use it as the key for symmetric encryption (e.g., AES256).

### Additional Notes / TO DO:
1. Use AES256 in GCM/CTR mode to ensure secure post-exchange communications
2. in Phase 3 after verifying the signed hash (`b_ss_hash`) it's not a good practice to use `asserteq!` since this migh lead to a DoS attack, it should delete the session properly
3. Even though as of right now AES256, Dilithium5 and Kyber1024 are hardcoded they should be easily reemplazable and depend on the demand of the communication
4. All communications should have a specific timestamp or nonce that will make it imposible to use a replay attack.
5. All keys, nonces and cryptographic data should be generated using a secure RNG such as rand::rngs::OsRng (Rust)
6. Server should also make sure shared secrets are the same to ensure resilience to key substitution attacks
8. After the session all keys should be completely overwritten & erased from memory use librarys like zeroize (Rust)
9. Cryptographic operations should use constant time to prevent timing attacks, use librarys like subtle (Rust)
10. Be aware of side-channel attacks such as timing attacks or power consumption, avoid patterns
11. Avoid completely leaving traces on Cache registers / Shared caches
12. Be carefull with resource consumption, even more at the start of the key exchange to avoid DoS
13. Ensure no Debug Symbols, Debug information or any other compile system data remains on the final binary
14. Use a global panic handler to ensure all sensitive data is wiped before the process dies
15. Ensure a minimum level of entropy in `/dev/urandom (Linux)` and `CryptGenRandom (Windows)` and make sure it's a secure RNG
16. Add version negotiation to ensure always a secure version of this protocol is used
